# Ubiquitous Business Logic

Extract, centralize, and maintain the actual business rules, domain knowledge, edge cases, deeplinks, analytics instrumentation, and implementation oddities as they exist in the codebase.

The goal is not to produce a generic architecture document. The goal is to make hidden product behavior easy to understand, verify, and maintain without losing precision.

## Operating Principles

- Preserve existing knowledge. Merge forward from the existing document instead of replacing it wholesale.
- Ground every claim in code. Include file names, functions, constants, schemas, route names, event names, or guard clauses wherever possible.
- Favor visual structure. Use diagrams, maps, checklists, matrices, and compact tables so readers can understand the system quickly.
- Separate product truth from implementation weirdness. Intended behavior, hacks, legacy support, vendor workarounds, and retired rules should not be mixed together.
- Be explicit about uncertainty. Mark behavior as `Confirmed`, `Partially confirmed`, `Contradicted`, or `Needs verification` based on the evidence found.
- Do not remove details. If information is still valid, keep it. If the code contradicts it, move it to discrepancies or retired logic only when evidence supports that change.

## Workflow

### 1. Extract claims from the current conversation

Capture rules, constraints, policies, workarounds, edge cases, deeplink expectations, analytics requirements, and any stated rationale. Pay special attention to:

- the reason the logic exists
- the user-visible behavior
- affected screens, routes, or flows
- analytics events and required params
- stated exceptions, overrides, and legacy behavior
- places where the user says the code should behave differently than it currently does

### 2. Read the existing business logic document

Read `docs/UBIQUITOUS_BUSINESS_LOGIC.md` if it exists.

Merge forward instead of overwriting:

| Existing content status | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Still matches implementation | Preserve and refresh evidence if needed. |
| More specific than new findings | Keep the specific version and add new supporting details. |
| Contradicted by code | Record the discrepancy and cite the code evidence. |
| No longer enforced | Move to `Retired Logic` only when the conversation or code explicitly supports retirement. |
| Unverified but important | Keep it only if clearly marked as needing verification. |

### 3. Inspect the codebase for implemented rules

Prioritize searches in:

- `use-cases` / `usecases`
- `services` / `handlers`
- `domain`
- `validators` / `schemas`
- `utils` / `helpers`
- `constants` / `config`
- `routes` / `navigation` / `linking` / `deeplink` / `deep-link`
- `analytics` / `tracking` / `events` / `telemetry` / `instrumentation`
- feature folders containing screens, controllers, view models, forms, or API clients

Use code search patterns such as:

```text
throw new
return false
return null
if (
switch (
TODO|FIXME|NOTE|HACK|WORKAROUND|legacy|grandfather
MAX_|MIN_|DEFAULT_|LIMIT_|THRESHOLD_|GRACE_
track|analytics|event|screen|error|telemetry
route|path|deeplink|deepLink|linking|url|scheme
```

### 4. Trace enforcement end to end

For each important rule, trace the path where possible:

```text
User/API input
  -> validation or schema rule
  -> use case / service guard clause
  -> persistence or external API call
  -> UI/screen presentation
  -> deeplink behavior, if applicable
  -> analytics events, if applicable
```

Document the concrete enforcement point, not just the call site. Guard clauses, thrown errors, validators, enum checks, and constants usually encode the real invariant.

### 5. Identify oddities, edge cases, and magic values

Actively look for:

- complex `if/else` or `switch` logic
- hardcoded IDs, dates, thresholds, status maps, and tenant-specific exceptions
- workarounds for third-party API limits
- legacy data handling and migration cutoffs
- domain constraints that feel counter-intuitive
- behavior that differs by platform, environment, app version, tenant, locale, or feature flag
- error states that are intentionally suppressed, transformed, or tracked differently
- analytics params that are conditionally included or renamed

### 6. Extract deeplinks and route behavior

Create a deeplink inventory when the codebase contains route/linking behavior or the conversation asks for it.

Look for:

- app schemes, universal links, route paths, URL builders, navigation config, and link parsers
- required, optional, deprecated, and ignored params
- screen destinations and fallback behavior
- auth or permission gates
- error handling for malformed, expired, or unauthorized links
- analytics fired when a link is opened, rejected, or redirected

Treat deeplinks as product behavior. A route that silently redirects, drops a param, or requires a specific auth state is business logic.

### 7. Extract analytics instrumentation

Create analytics inventories when the codebase contains analytics/tracking behavior or the conversation asks for it.

Split analytics by event category:

| Category | What to document |
| --- | --- |
| Screen events | screen/view events, screen names, route or component source, required params, optional params, firing conditions |
| Error events | error names, error codes, failure surfaces, suppression rules, retry/fallback behavior, user-visible message mapping |
| Track events | action events, event names, required params, optional params, triggering user/system action, dedupe or throttling behavior |

For each event, document the source file and the condition that causes the event to fire. If event params are assembled across multiple helper functions, cite both the event call and the param builder.

### 8. Categorize findings by bounded context or feature

Group findings so they are discoverable by domain area such as Billing, Identity, Inventory, Scheduling, Eligibility, Onboarding, Notifications, Navigation, Deeplinks, or Analytics.

When a rule spans multiple areas, place it in the context where the business decision lives and cross-reference related enforcement locations in the evidence table.

### 9. Write or rewrite the document

Ensure a `docs` directory exists in the project root. Write the file exactly here:

```text
docs/UBIQUITOUS_BUSINESS_LOGIC.md
```

Use the output structure below. Keep every section, even if some tables contain `None found` or `Needs verification` rows.

### 10. Return a short inline summary

After writing the file, return a short summary with:

- the most critical rules found
- the weirdest oddities uncovered
- deeplinks or analytics coverage added
- discrepancies between user claims and actual code behavior
- any areas needing follow-up verification

## Investigation Heuristics

- Start at guard clauses and thrown errors. These usually encode the real invariants.
- Read validation schemas for format rules, bounds, enums, and conditional requirements.
- Search comments near complex logic for `TODO`, `FIXME`, `NOTE`, and `HACK`.
- Inspect third-party integration code for business rules forced by vendor limitations.
- Treat constants and config files as likely sources of status maps, limits, grace periods, feature flags, and analytics names.
- Follow important domain values from input validation through persistence and outward-facing presentation.
- For deeplinks, test route matching mentally from URL shape to destination screen and fallback behavior.
- For analytics, verify both the event name and the params. A correct event with wrong or missing params is incomplete instrumentation documentation.

## Visual Documentation Patterns

Use these patterns to make the output easier to scan while preserving detail.

### Context Map

Use a context map near the top of the generated document when multiple areas interact:

```text
[Eligibility] -> gates -> [Checkout]
[Checkout] -> emits -> [Billing Analytics]
[Deeplink] -> routes to -> [Plan Selection]
[Errors] -> maps to -> [User-facing Messages]
```

### Rule Lifecycle

Use this compact shape for rules that move through multiple layers:

```text
Input constraint -> validator -> service guard -> persisted state -> UI outcome -> analytics event
```

### Confidence Labels

Use these labels consistently:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Confirmed | Directly verified in code. |
| Partially confirmed | Some evidence found, but implementation path is incomplete. |
| Contradicted | Conversation or existing doc conflicts with current code. |
| Needs verification | Important claim exists but code evidence was not found. |
| Retired | Evidence shows the system no longer enforces this logic. |

## Writing Rules

- Be precise. State the rule clearly, then explain why it exists when evidence supports it.
- Separate intended domain behavior from hacks, legacy accommodations, and technical workarounds.
- Ground every claim in codebase evidence. Include file names or function names in relevant table cells.
- Focus on business logic, not framework or infrastructure choices.
- Be honest about weirdness. If the code contains tenant-specific hacks or legacy cutoffs, document them directly.
- Keep retired logic limited to rules the system no longer enforces.
- Keep visual aids factual. Do not invent relationships just to make the document look complete.
- Prefer concise table rows with exact evidence over long prose paragraphs.
- Preserve all still-valid details from the existing document, even when reorganizing sections.

## Output Structure

Write `docs/UBIQUITOUS_BUSINESS_LOGIC.md` with exactly this structure:

```md

## System / Context Map

```text
[Add a compact map of the relevant bounded contexts, flows, routes, analytics, and integrations.]
```

## Bounded Context: [Context Name, e.g., Billing]

### Quick Mental Model

```text
[Summarize the context in 3-8 lines: inputs -> decisions -> outputs -> analytics/deeplinks if applicable.]
```

### Core Business Rules

| Rule | Description & Rationale | Enforced In | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Proration on Downgrade** | When a user downgrades mid-cycle, the remaining balance is credited to their account, not refunded to their card. *Rationale: Reduces transaction fees and prevents refund abuse.* | `SubscriptionService.downgrade()` | Confirmed |
| **Minimum Charge** | Invoices under $0.50 are deferred to the next billing cycle. *Rationale: Stripe minimum processing fees.* | `InvoiceGenerator`, `Constants.MIN_CHARGE` | Confirmed |

### Rule Flow / Decision Points

| Flow Step | Decision / Branch | Outcome | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Downgrade request | User is mid-cycle | Credit remaining balance to account | `SubscriptionService.downgrade()` |

## Final Checks

Re-read the generated document before finishing.

- Ensure the file is saved strictly as `docs/UBIQUITOUS_BUSINESS_LOGIC.md`.
- Ensure generic technical details are omitted in favor of actual domain constraints.
- Ensure the `System / Context Map` and `Quick Mental Model` sections make the document easier to understand without simplifying away important details.
- Ensure each bounded context keeps the required tables, even when there are no deeplinks or analytics events found.
- Ensure deeplinks include destination, required params, optional params, guards/fallbacks, related analytics, evidence, and status.
- Ensure analytics are split into `Screen Events`, `Error Events`, and `Track Events`, with required and optional params documented separately.
- Ensure the `Edge Cases & Oddities` section is brutally honest about hacks and workarounds found in the code.
- Ensure the retired section contains only rules the system actively no longer enforces.
- Ensure every non-obvious claim has code evidence or is explicitly marked as needing verification.
